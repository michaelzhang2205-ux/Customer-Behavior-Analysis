## **Overview**

This project demonstrates a complete analytics workflow — from raw data to business insights.

As a graduate in **Economics and Business Mathematics**, I built this project to reflect how I approach real-world business problems: structured thinking, quantitative analysis, and clear communication of results.

This project includes:

- Loading and exploring data in **Python**
- Cleaning and preparing data for analysis
- Writing SQL queries in **PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server**
- Building an interactive **Power BI dashboard**
- Delivering insights through a written report and executive presentation

The objective was to simulate the responsibilities of an entry-level **Business or Data Analyst** in a real organization.

## **Dataset**

The dataset contains transactional and customer-level data used to analyze:

- Revenue performance
- Customer behavior
- Product and category trends
- Regional comparisons
- Key performance indicators (KPIs)

The data was first explored in Python and later structured in a relational database to support SQL-based analysis.

---

## **Tools & Technologies**

- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)**
- **PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server**
- **Power BI**
- **Excel (validation and cross-checking)**
- **Gamma (executive presentation)**

---

## **Project Workflow**

### **1. Data Loading & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- Imported raw data using Pandas
- Reviewed structure, data types, and summary statistics
- Identified missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies
- Explored distributions and trends to understand patterns

This phase focused on understanding the data before drawing conclusions.

---

### **2. Data Cleaning & Preparation**

- Removed duplicate records
- Handled missing values appropriately
- Standardized date formats and categorical variables
- Created calculated fields to support KPI analysis

The goal was to ensure the dataset was accurate, consistent, and analysis-ready.

---

### **3. SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)**

After cleaning, the dataset was loaded into a relational database to simulate a real business environment.

SQL queries were written using:

- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`
- Aggregation functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`)
- Table joins
- Subqueries and window functions

These queries were used to analyze:

- Revenue by segment
- Customer purchase behavior
- Category-level performance
- Regional revenue comparisons

This reflects how analysts typically extract insights from structured databases in professional settings.

---

### **4. Power BI Dashboard Development**

An interactive dashboard was developed to communicate findings clearly and effectively.

The dashboard includes:

- Revenue trends over time
- Segment and category performance
- Geographic breakdown
- KPI summary metrics
- Interactive filters for deeper exploration

The focus was on clarity, usability, and business relevance.

---

### **5. Reporting & Presentation**

To complete the project:

- A structured analytical report was created
- Key insights and recommendations were summarized
---

## **Key Insights**

- Identified primary revenue-driving customer segments
- Highlighted top-performing product categories
- Detected geographic concentration trends
- Provided data-backed recommendations for performance improvement

Beyond technical execution, this project demonstrates my ability to connect quantitative analysis with strategic business thinking

---

## **Professional Focus**

This project reflects how I approach analytical work:

- Structured and methodical
- Quantitatively grounded
- Business-oriented
- Clear in communication

With formal training in Economics and Business Mathematics, I aim to combine analytical rigor with practical insight — the foundation for strong performance in entry-level analyst roles.
