# Customer-Behavior-Analysis
Data Analysis Project displaying a series of customer behavior analysis using  PostgreSQL, Python, Excel, and Power BI.
**Overview**

This project showcases a complete analytics workflow — from raw data to business insights.

As a graduate in Economics and Business Mathematics, I built this project to reflect how I approach real-world business problems: structured thinking, quantitative analysis, and clear communication of results.

The project walks through:

Loading and exploring data in Python

Cleaning and preparing data for analysis

Writing SQL queries in PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server

Building an interactive Power BI dashboard

Delivering insights through a written report and executive presentation

The objective was simple: simulate what an entry-level analyst would actually do on the job.

**Dataset**

The dataset includes transactional and customer-level data used to analyze:

Revenue performance

Customer behavior

Product/category trends

Regional comparisons

Key performance indicators (KPIs)

The data was first explored in Python, then structured in a relational database to support SQL-based analysis.

Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)

PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server

Power BI

Excel (for validation and cross-checking)

Microsoft Powerpoint

**Project Workflow **
**1. Data Loading & Exploratory Analysis (Python)
**
Imported raw data using Pandas

Reviewed structure, data types, and summary statistics

Identified missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies

Explored distributions and trends to understand overall patterns

This phase focused on understanding the data before jumping into conclusions.

**2. Data Cleaning & Preparation
**
Removed duplicate records

Handled missing values appropriately

Standardized date formats and categorical fields

Created calculated fields to support KPI analysis

The goal was to ensure the dataset was accurate, consistent, and analysis-ready.

**3. SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
**
After cleaning, the data was loaded into a relational database to simulate a real business environment.

I wrote SQL queries using:

SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY

Aggregation functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT)

Joins across multiple tables

Subqueries and window functions

These queries were used to calculate:

Revenue by segment

Customer purchase patterns

Category-level performance

Regional revenue comparisons

This step reflects how analysts typically extract insights from structured databases.

**4. Power BI Dashboard
**
I built an interactive dashboard to communicate findings clearly and visually.

The dashboard includes:

Revenue trends over time

Segment and category performance

Geographic breakdown

KPI summary metrics

Interactive filters for deeper exploration

The focus was not just visualization — but clarity and usability for decision-makers.

**5. Reporting & Presentation
**
To complete the project, I:

Created a structured analytical report

Summarized key findings and recommendations

Developed an executive-style presentation using Gamma

This stage emphasized translating technical analysis into business insights.

**Key Insights
**
Identified primary revenue-driving segments

Highlighted top-performing categories

Detected geographic concentration trends

Provided data-backed recommendations for performance improvement

Beyond the technical work, this project demonstrates my ability to connect quantitative analysis with practical business decisions — a core skill developed through my background in Economics and Business Mathematics.
